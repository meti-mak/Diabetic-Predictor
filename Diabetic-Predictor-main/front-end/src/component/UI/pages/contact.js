            <p>
              Diabetes is a chronic condition affecting millions worldwide, and its silent progression often goes unnoticed
              until severe symptoms appear. By leveraging modern AI tools, our project helps users assess risk factors
              earlyâ€”using medical data such as glucose levels, BMI, age, and more.
            </p>
            <p>
              The website features a clean and interactive interface where users can enter basic health indicators and
              instantly get a prediction powered by a trained machine learning model. Our aim is to raise awareness,
              encourage regular health checkups, and ultimately support healthier living through tech-driven solutions.
            </p>
            <p>
              We believe in the power of data to prevent disease rather than just treat it. This project reflects our
              dedication to innovation, accessibility, and community health.
